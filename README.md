## ðŸ“– Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip records to derive meaningful insights such as:

- Financial performance
- Trip patterns
- User preferences
- Operational efficiency

The data includes trip time, pickup/drop-off locations, payment methods, and more. The analysis is performed using Python and includes visual storytelling through graphs and dashboards.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

The project aims to answer several analytical questions:

1. **What is the average booking value per trip?**
2. **What is the average trip duration across different cities?**
3. **What is the total trip distance covered over time?**
4. **How many bookings are made in total, and what is the overall revenue?**
5. **How do bookings vary by month and city?**
6. **Which payment methods are used most frequently?**
7. **How does rider behavior differ between day and night trips?**
8. **What are the busiest and least-used pickup locations?**
9. **Which areas have the most popular pick-up/drop-off combinations?**
10. **What are the daily booking trends?**

|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Trip ID            | Unique identifier for each trip             |
| Pickup Time        | Timestamp of trip start                     |
| Drop-off Time      | Timestamp of trip end                       |
| Pickup Location    | Latitude/longitude or city zone             |

## ðŸ”§ Data Processing

- **Datetime parsing** to extract hour, day, and month
- **Trip duration** calculated as difference between drop-off and pickup times
- **Booking classification** into `Day` and `Night` categories
- **City filtering** to analyze data from multiple regions
- **Outlier handling** for extremely short or long trips
- **Aggregations** to compute KPIs like total revenue, trip count, etc.

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Modules

Below are the key modules covered in the analysis:

### 1. Financial Overview
- Total revenue
- Average trip value
- Booking value distribution

### 2. Temporal Analysis
- Bookings by day of the week
- Monthly booking trends
- Hourly analysis: peak vs off-peak times

### 3. City-Based Filtering
- City-wise trip count and revenue
- Average trip duration by city

### 4. Trip Duration & Distance
- Average time per trip
- Total and average trip distance
- Distance vs fare relationship

### 5. Day vs Night Analysis
- Total bookings in day/night
- Revenue comparison
- Behavior pattern variations

### 6. Payment Methods
- Distribution of payment types
- City-wise payment trends
- Percentage share of each method

### 7. Location Analytics
- Most frequent pickup points
- Least used locations
- Top routes (pickup â†’ drop-off)
- Heatmap or cluster map of locations *(if visualized)*

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The following types of visualizations are included:

- Bar charts for booking trends
- Line charts for daily/monthly insights
- Heatmaps for pickup/drop-off frequencies
- Pie charts for payment method usage
- Histograms for trip distances and durations
- Scatter plots (e.g. fare vs distance)
